		<p class=highlight> Anthony "Tony" John Soprano (born August 22, 1959), also known as Tony Soprano, 
		is the De facto Boss of the DiMeo crime family. </p>
		
		<p id="about_text">
			Tony has to juggle North Jersey's most powerful criminal organization, keeping it functioning properly and keeping dissonance to a minimum. The relationship between Tony and his uncle, Corrado John Soprano, Jr. (better known as Junior Soprano), was very close for many years, with Junior acting as a father figure for Tony following the death of Giovanni (AKA Johnny Boy) Soprano, Tony's father. However, the relationship was strained when a disgruntled Junior became more and more marginalized in the organization as the FBI's investigation into his activities increased. He had Brendan Filone killed, which infuriated Tony. Furthermore, he conspired with Tony's own mother, Livia Soprano, to have Tony killed (although the hit failed). Before Tony realized his mother had helped to plan the attack on him, he had been very close to her and had taken care of her. But Tony's mother was a bitter and pessimistic woman who rejected Tony's help and became very angry with him when he placed her in a retirement community, which Livia claimed was a "nursing home". After the attempt on Tony's life, he proceeds to confront his mother at the retirement home, but discovers she has had a stroke. This does not deter Tony's rage as he angrily lets his mother know that he found out about the truth. Their relationship after this nearly deteriorat			es, as Tony barely speaks to her after that. </p>
		<p>
		Despite a level of local notoriety, Tony has represented himself publicly as a waste management consultant to Barone Sanitation, one of the many fronts for his criminal enterprises. Tony had been using his putative nephew Christopher Moltisanti as a buffer between him and his capos during the past two seasons in order to insulate himself from the FBI. This subterfuge ended when Moltisanti was killed by Tony after an automobile accident. Christopher was driving while high on heroin and serves off off the road to avoid hitting an oncoming car. The car rolls off a hill and crashes upright. Tony, who was wearing his seat belt, manages to escape from the wrecked car relatively unscathed, but Christopher, who was not wearing his seat belt, is coughing up blood and may have severe internal injuries. Christopher admits that they seek medical aid or report this to the police, they will probably administer drug tests, which he will likely fail, so he asks for Tony to help him escape. After seeing a large branch destroy the empty baby seat in the rear seat, Tony is a aghast that if Christopher's daughter had been riding with them, the accident would have obviously killed her. Tony finally decides that while he loved Christopher, he would always be unreliable and dangerous to others. Instead of calling 911, he suffocates Christopher to death. In a dream sequence, Tony tells his true feelings about Christopher's death to Dr Melfi, saying: "I am relieved, he was a tremendous drag on my emotions, on my thoughts about the future. Every morning I wake up thinking, is today, the day that one of my best friends is gonna dime me to the FBI? And a weak fucking sniveling lying drug addict is the worst kind of bet.

		Bobby Baccalieri was being groomed as Moltisanti's replacement until he was killed by Phil Leotardo's hitmen when the Lupertazzi crime family launched a war against the DiMeo Crime Family. Tony managed to strike a truce with Phil's underlings, however, and after Phil is assassinated, Tony returns safely to his criminal enterprise. He is last shown having dinner with his family at the famous Holstein's restaurant in New Jersey, though the possibility of a criminal indictment, thanks to a gun charge and testimony from Carlo Gervasi, looms over his head. A patron in Holsten's credited as "Man in Members Only Jacket" ominously looks twice in Tony's direction and then walks past Tony's booth to the bathroom, and walks out. As the song "Don't Stop Believin'" plays in the background, the screen instantly cuts to black as Tony looks up, representing the fact that he himself, has been hit.
