OVERVIEW
--------------------
This project was made for CS-2610, the web development class at Utah State University. 
The program functions as a blog website for a fictional character (Tony Soprano in this case). The program allows
users to upload comments to certain premade blogs, saving the data and allowing users to see it later after refresh.
